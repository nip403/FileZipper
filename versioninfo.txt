/======\
| TODO |
\======/

- Add support for gui interface, add -g option (exclusive)
- optimisation with numpy - decode
- support for multiple file types about 100 are letters
- change reformat bin func to only do scalars
- optimise ascii to use unused digits (only)
    - maybe use spare bit for capitals
- support for all text & code extensions
    - Add byte at the end to support extension type
- Display before & after file sizes, compression efficiency
- Force install 'bitarray' module within script
- Implement builtin bytearray type in huffman_io_engine._get_tree for faster r/w
- make character storage dynamic
    - therefore max storage for data byte is a nibble
    - Revamp entire decompression program to accommodate for nibbles

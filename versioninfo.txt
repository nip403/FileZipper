/======\
| TODO |
\======/

----> optimisation
- optimisation with numpy - decode
- optimise ascii to use unused digits (only)
    - maybe use spare bit for capitals
- Implement builtin bytearray type in huffman_io_engine._get_tree for faster r/w
- make character storage dynamic
    - therefore max storage for data byte is a nibble
    - Revamp entire decompression program to accommodate for nibbles

----> high priority
- fix string decompression function
- finish commenting on nippify.py and building huffman process
- add examples to github & include tests in readme

----> med priority
- make overload decorator
    - overload main in nippify and de/compression functions
- Display before & after file sizes, compression efficiency

----> low priority
- Add support for gui interface, add -g option (exclusive)
- change reformat bin func to only do scalars
- support for all text & code extensions
    - Add byte at the end to support extension type
- Force install 'bitarray' module within script
- make it into bash/cmd program - pyinstaller
